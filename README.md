Console Application in Java implementing the DES algorithm using pseudo-random generated S-boxes,using as input  a hexadecimal string.
Thereupon, the random generated S-boxes used for the message encryption are evaluated for their strength against differential cryptanalysis 
and are compared with the recommended ones by implementing a sage method in Java.
